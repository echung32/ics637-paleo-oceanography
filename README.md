# Paleo Oceanography

> This is an image-classification competition. The images are microscope images of single celled organisms, foraminifera (forams) taken from bore hole samples of the ocean floor. The goal is to classify each image into one of 53 species, with one class reserved for "non forams". These organisms are interesting to scientists because they play an important role in the carbon cycle.
